# Portfolio Website

This is the content of my personal website hosted at [ayanev.eu](https://ayanev.eu).

The theme which I have used is [hugo-developer-portfolio](https://github.com/samrobbins85/hugo-developer-portfolio).

```shell
# Add hugo.exe to project dir, check version from .gitignore
hugo version
hugo serve

# Deploy
./deploy.sh
```
